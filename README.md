# Azure Tools for Visual Studio Code

This extension for [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com) gives Azure developers some convenient commands for creating or accessing resources directly in the editor. 

## Features

- Interactive Login, with support for Azure Active Directory accounts right out of the box.

    Microsoft accounts are also supported, so you can log in using @outlook.com, @live.com, or @hotmail.com services. To enable MSA login, add the GUID of your AAD tenant to your workspace configuration using the `azure.tenantId` setting this extension contributes.

- Multiple subscription support, so if you have multiple Azure subscriptions associated with your login you'll be able to switch between them easily.

- Browse resources in the Azure portal shows a pick list of all your resources. When clicked, you'll go right to the portal blade for that resource.

- Web App creation - using either an advanced or simple mode, you can create new Azure App Service Web Apps directly from within Visual Studio Code.

    Advanced mode allows you to create or select new or existing resource groups and server farms.

    Simple mode creates a new resource group, server farm, and Web App after typing in the name of the Web App.
